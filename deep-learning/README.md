# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

# Prerequisites
The implementations mostly used PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
- [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)

## Description
- Transformers are suitable for many kind of NLP tasks. Our repo contains the `usage` and `finetune` code for the following tasks:
  - [Question Answering](question-answering)
  - [Sentence Prediction](sentence-prediction)
  - [Word Prediction](word-prediction)
- If you are new to deep learning, please consider starting from the `usage` folder. It should get you familiar with deep learning NLP models, without encountering technical details.
- If you are already experienced with deep learning model, you can start with the `finetune` folder. It should help you get better prediction accuracy, by fitting the pre-trained models to your custom dataset.
